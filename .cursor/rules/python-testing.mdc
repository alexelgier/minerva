description: Python quick testing workflow to avoid Cursor inline runner issues

# Python Quick Testing Rule

## Problem
Cursor inline runner fails silently when running Python code that's 4+ lines long, causing wasted time and frustration.

## Solution
- **1-3 lines**: Use `poetry run python -c "code"` (works fine)
- **4+ lines**: Use [backend/scratch.py](mdc:backend/scratch.py) workflow:
  1. Edit [backend/scratch.py](mdc:backend/scratch.py) with your test code
  2. Run `poetry run python backend/scratch.py`
  3. Delete the file when done

## Examples
```bash
# Short test (works)
poetry run python -c "print('hello')"

# Long test (use scratch.py)
# Edit backend/scratch.py with your code, then:
poetry run python backend/scratch.py
# Then delete the file
```

## Rule
**NEVER waste time with Cursor inline runner for multi-line Python code!** Always use the scratch file approach for 4+ line Python tests. This prevents silent failures and saves significant time.
