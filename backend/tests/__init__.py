Minerva Backend Test Suite

This package contains comprehensive tests for the Minerva Backend system.
Tests are organized into unit tests and integration tests.

Unit Tests:
- Test individual components in isolation
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Fast execution

Integration Tests:
- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies (Neo4j, Ollama, etc.)
- Slower execution but more realistic
